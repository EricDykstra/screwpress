### Screwpress

Like Wordpress, but named after a different ancient printing press mechanism. It's a simple blog app that I built in Sinatra during a DBC solo day. It's the first Ruby-based web app I built on my own, and it was in the fourth week of Dev Bootcamp and our first week of the "Web" section of the program.
